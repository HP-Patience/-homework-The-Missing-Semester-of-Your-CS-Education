# Exercises

1. Read [`man ls`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) and write an `ls` command that lists files in the following manner

   - Includes all files, including hidden files
   - Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)
   - Files are ordered by recency
   - Output is colorized

   A sample output would look like this

   ```
   -rw-r--r--   1 user group 1.1M Jan 14 09:53 baz
   drwxr-xr-x   5 user group  160 Jan 14 09:53 .
   -rw-r--r--   1 user group  514 Jan 14 06:42 bar
   -rw-r--r--   1 user group 106M Jan 13 12:12 foo
   drwx------+ 47 user group 1.5K Jan 12 18:08 ..
   ```



2. Write bash functions  `marco` and `polo` that do the following.
   Whenever you execute `marco` the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute `polo`, no matter what directory you are in, `polo` should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`.
   For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file `marco.sh` and (re)load the definitions to your shell by executing `source marco.sh`.



3. Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run.
   Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end.
   Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.

```bash
 #!/usr/bin/env bash

 n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))

 if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
    echo "Something went wrong"
    >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
    exit 1
 fi

 echo "Everything went according to plan"
```



4. As we covered in the lecture `find`'s `-exec` can be very powerful for performing operations over the files we are searching for.
   However, what if we want to do something with **all** the files, like creating a zip file?
   As you have seen so far commands will take input from both arguments and STDIN.
   When piping commands, we are connecting STDOUT to STDIN, but some commands like `tar` take inputs from arguments.
   To bridge this disconnect there's the [`xargs`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html) command which will execute a command using STDIN as arguments.
   For example `ls | xargs rm` will delete the files in the current directory.

   

   Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them. Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check `-d` flag for `xargs`).
   

If you're on macOS, note that the default BSD `find` is different from the one included in [GNU coreutils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands). You can use `-print0` on `find` and the `-0` flag on `xargs`. As a macOS user, you should be aware that command-line utilities shipped with macOS may differ from the GNU counterparts; you can install the GNU versions if you like by [using brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils).

5. (Advanced) Write a command or script to recursively find the most recently modified file in a directory. More generally, can you list all files by recency?



# Solution

1. Read [`man ls`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) and write an `ls` command that lists files in the following manner

   - Includes all files, including hidden files

   - Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)

   - Files are ordered by recency

   - Output is colorized

1.1 Includes all files, including hidden files

```BASH
ls -a
```

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

1.2 Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)

```BASH
ls -h
```

       -h, --human-readable
              with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.

1.3 Files are ordered by recency

==最新的文件在前==

```BASH
ls -t
```

```BASH
       -t     sort by time, newest first; see --time
```

1.4 Output is colorized

```BASH
ls --color=auto
```

       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize  the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default if omitted),
              'auto', or 'never'; more info below

==PS==:

`ls --color` 的 `always` 和 `auto` 参数的区别在于输出中颜色的显示方式。使用 `--color=always` 会始终显示颜色，不论输出是否是终端；而 `--color=auto` 则仅在输出到终端时显示颜色，如果输出被重定向到文件或管道，则不会显示颜色。这样可以更好地适应不同的输出环境。





2. Write bash functions  `marco` and `polo` that do the following.
   Whenever you execute `marco` the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute `polo`, no matter what directory you are in, `polo` should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`.
   For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file `marco.sh` and (re)load the definitions to your shell by executing `source marco.sh`.

```BASH
vim marco.sh
```

```BASH
#!/bin/bash
marco()
{
        echo $(pwd) > $HOME/marco_history.log
        echo "save pwd in $PWD"
}

polo()
{
        cd $(cat $HOME/marco_history.log)
        echo "return marco_pwd" || echo "Failed to change directory"
}
```

```BASH
source ./marco.sh
```

==测试==：

```bash
marco
```

```BASH
polo
```





3. Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run.mk
   Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end.
   Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.

==下列代码中>&2表示将标准输出流输入到标准错误流中==

```bash
 #!/usr/bin/env bash

 n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))

 if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
    echo "Something went wrong"
    >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
    exit 1
 fi

 echo "Everything went according to plan"
```

==下列代码中$>>表示将标准输出流和标准错误流均追加到out.log文件中==

```BASH
#!/bin/bash
count=0
echo > out.log

while true
do
        ./script_debug.sh &>> out.log
        if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
                echo "$count runs it took for the script to fail."
                exit 0
        fi
        ((count++))

done
```

   Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them. Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check `-d` flag for `xargs`).

Solution:

```bash
find *.html | xargs tar -czvf yasuobao.tar.gz
```

Explain:

```
-czvf

-c means create

-z means using gzip

-v means 显示正在进行操作的文件

-f means target file path
```

5. (Advanced) Write a command or script to recursively find the most recently modified file in a directory. More generally, can you list all files by recency?

Input:

```BASH
ls -t | sed -n "2p"
```

Output:
```BASH
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 143 Sep 29 11:31 yasuobao.tar.gz
```

Explain:

```BASH
sed i.e.“Stream Editor”

-n "2p" means output the second line of the input

By the way,the first line is "total 4".
```
